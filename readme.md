## Project Overview

Golden Outlook University centralizes educational material and example projects for teaching pitch strategy, marketing fundamentals, and client-facing presentation techniques.

Use this repository to:
- Store slides, templates, and course notes
- Keep example code and tiny web demos used in lessons
- Share exercises and grading rubrics with students

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and open the project directory:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd goldenoutlook.university
```

This repo is intentionally generic. Below are common workflows — remove sections that don't apply.

### If the project contains Node.js examples

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # or `npm start` depending on package.json
```

### If the project contains Python examples

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Development

- Keep example projects small and focused.
- Add README files inside subfolders to explain each lesson or example.
- Use meaningful commit messages for lesson updates (e.g., "add module: value proposition").

Suggested git workflow:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add lesson on positioning statements"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/<short-description>
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To propose a change:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a descriptive branch.
3. Open a pull request with a clear summary of changes.

Please include a short note explaining the purpose of new material and any instructor-facing notes.

## License

This repository does not include a license by default. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want permissive reuse (for example, the MIT license):

```

```

If you need a different license for course materials, replace the above with the appropriate license text.
